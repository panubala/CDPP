Phase cfg failed because we expected to see:
digraph G {
  graph [ rankdir = "LR" ];
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    label = "Main.main"
    M0_BB0 [
      shape="record"
      label="BB0|write(0)|writeln()"
    ];
    M0_BB0 -> M0_BB1;
    M0_BB1 [
      shape="record"
      label="BB1"
    ];
  }
}

But we actually saw:
digraph G {
  graph [ rankdir = "LR" ];
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    label = "Main.main"
    M0_BB0 [
      shape="record"
      label="BB0"
    ];
    M0_BB1 [
      shape="record"
      label="BB1"
    ];
  }
}

The difference is:
At line   7 /   7:
<       label="BB0|write(0)|writeln()"
>       label="BB0"
At line   9 /   9:
<     M0_BB0 -> M0_BB1;
Line  16 /  15:
