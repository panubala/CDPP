Phase nn failed because we expected to see:
Main.main
  BB0 out: [a]
    a = new Main(): []
    a = null: [a]
    a = this: []
  BB1 out: [a]



But we actually saw:
Main.main
  BB0 out: []
    a = new Main(): []
    a = null: []
    a = this: []
  BB1 out: []



The difference is:
At line   2 /   2:
<   BB0 out: [a]
>   BB0 out: []
At line   4 /   4:
<     a = null: [a]
>     a = null: []
At line   6 /   6:
<   BB1 out: [a]
>   BB1 out: []
